#  Watercolor Filter
Final Project in Digital Imaging Systems (E E 440)

Implements a watercolor filter as described in "Expressive Rendering with Water Color". Simulated watercolor turbulence with several instances of randomized Gaussian noise.

Uses mean-shift image segmentation implemented by Rutger's Edge Detection and Image SegmentatiON system (EDISON).
The source code can be found at http://rci.rutgers.edu/~meer/RIUL/research/code/EDISON/.
